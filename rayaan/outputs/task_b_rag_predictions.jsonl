The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned.

The natural network and system characteristics of the network might mean that changes made to a document stored in one location can't instantly update or replicate to other parts of the database.\n\nIn other words, independent updates can be made to different copies of documents. The effect of these updates might be to introduce disagreement or \"conflicts\" as to what is the correct, definitive content for the document.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae tries to help you avoid conflicts by warning you of potential problems. It warns you by returning a [409 response](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantlist-of-http-codes) to a problematic update request. However, a 409 response might not be received if the database update is requested on a system that isn't currently connected to the network. For example, the database might be on a mobile device that is temporarily disconnected from the Internet, which makes it impossible to check whether other potentially conflicting updates were made.\n\nIf you request a document that is in a conflict situation, IBM Cloudant returns the document as expected. However, an internal algorithm considers a number of factors before it determines which document version to return. You must not assume that the returned document is the most recent version.\n\nFor example, if you don't check for conflicts, or fail to address them, your IBM Cloudant database can exhibit the following behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Increasing inconsistencies in document content because more conflicting documents occur.\n* Increasing database size because all conflicting documents must be kept until the conflict is resolved.\n* Decreasing performance because IBM Cloudant must work harder in response to each request as it tries to identify the \"best possible\" version of a conflicted document.\n\n\n\nThe following suggested practices might help you decide when to check for, and resolve, conflicts:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Users can choose between partitioned and non-partitioned databases based on their specific needs and environment.\n\nQuestion: How can I ensure optimal performance and cost savings with IBM Cloudant?\nAnswer: To achieve optimal performance and cost savings with IBM Cloudant, consider using a partitioned database. This approach enables faster querying of cached documents and reduces the need for frequent re-indexing of large datasets. Additionally, partitioning ensures that queries targeted at a particular document partition are executed more efficiently, leading to improved performance and reduced costs compared to global queries.\n\nQuestion: Can I use non-partitioned databases with IBM Cloudant?\nAnswer: While non-partitioned databases like IBM Cloudant support partitioning, they may require additional configuration and setup steps to ensure optimal performance and cost savings. It is recommended to consult the IBM documentation for specific details on configuring a non-partitioned database with IBM Cloudant.\n\nQuestion: What are the differences between partitioned and non-partitioned databases?\nAnswer: Partitioned databases, also known as partitioned databases, enable global and partition queries, offering significant performance and cost advantages over global queries. On the other hand, non-partitioned databases maintain consistency across multiple partitions, reducing the risk of data inconsistency issues. Choosing between the two depends on the specific use case and performance requirements.\n\nQuestion: Are there any guidelines for using partitioned databases with IBM Cloudant?\nAnswer: Yes, IBM recommends using a partitioned database for best long-term database performance. Partitioning helps to improve performance and reduce storage requirements by distributing the data across multiple partitions. Additionally, partitioning can enhance scalability and availability, making it suitable for applications with high traffic or those requiring high durability.\n\nQuestion: How should I handle conflicts when working with partitioned databases?\nAnswer: Conflicts arise when there are conflicting documents in different partitions of a partitioned database. To mitigate these conflicts, you should:\n\n1. Set up conflict resolution rules in your database management system (DBMS).\n2. Use indexing strategies that minimize the likelihood of conflicts occurring during insertions, updates, and deletions.\n3. Regularly review and adjust your conflict handling policies to align with business requirements and data quality standards.\n\nBy following these practices, you can help prevent conflicts and ensure that your IBM Cloudant database operates smoothly and efficiently, providing better performance and cost savings for your applications."}]}

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

Use the `Cloudant` plugin available in the IBM Cloudant documentation to streamline the process. This plugin allows you to easily manage your documents and ensure they adhere to the rules outlined above.\n3. Remember to respect the limitations imposed by the context. As mentioned earlier, certain document types may require additional configuration or processing, such as splitting documents into multiple records or converting images to a different format.\n4. Keep in mind that even though IBM Cloudant is designed for documents, it can still handle attachments and small static assets efficiently. By understanding how attachments work, you can tailor your approach to maximize performance without compromising on functionality.\n5. Consider the implications of using attachments in conjunction with IBM Cloudant. While it provides powerful tools for analyzing and processing attachments, it's important to evaluate the trade-offs carefully. In some cases, it might be more beneficial to use separate solutions, like server-side rendering for contracts, rather than relying solely on IBM Cloudant for content management.\n6. Finally, always verify the integrity and accuracy of your documents after exporting them to avoid potential issues down the line. Regularly updating your documents and checking their consistency ensures smooth operations and reduces the risk of data errors or inconsistencies.
