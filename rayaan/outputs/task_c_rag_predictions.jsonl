Libraries for parsing and generating JSON are available for many major programming languages.\n\nJSON is used because it's the simplest and easiest solution for working with data that uses a web browser.

Here\u2019s how you can set this up:\n\n### Using Inline Attachment\n\n#### Example JSON Document with Inline Attachment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_id\": \"document_with_attachment\",\n  \"_attachments\": {\n    \"name_of_attachment\": {\n      \"content_type\": \"image/jpeg\",\n      \"data\": \"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAGJREFUK5BVdYvQ=\",\n      \"type\": \"image/jpeg\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `_attachments` key contains an array where each item represents an attachment. Each attachment has its own properties like `content_type`, `data`, and `type`.\n\n#### Steps to Use Inline Attachment\n\n1. **Add the Attachment**: Add the inline attachment to the JSON document containing the document. The format is similar to the base64 encoded data, e.g., `\"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAGJREFUK5BVdYvQ=`.\n\n2. **Create the Document**: When creating a new document, include the inline attachment as an `inline` component.\n\n   ```javascript\n   var cloudant = require('cloudant');\n   \n   // Initialize the cloudant client\n   var cloudantClient = new cloudant('your_cloudant_url', 'your_api_key', {host: 'your_cloudant_host'});\n   \n   var db = cloudantClient.openDatabase();\n   \n   // Example usage: Create a new document with inline attachment\n   var doc = db.doc(\"collection_name\", \"document_id\");\n   doc.put({\n     _id: \"new_document\",\n     attachments: [\n       {\n         name: \"Image\",\n         contentType: \"image/jpeg\",\n         data: \"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAGJREFUK5BVdYvQ=\",\n         type: \"image/jpeg\"\n       },\n       {\n         name: \"PDF\",\n         contentType: \"application/pdf\",\n         data: \"This is a sample PDF file.\",\n         type: \"application/pdf\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }, function(err, response) {\n     if (!err && response.statusCode == 200) {\n       console.log(\"Document created successfully.\");\n     }"}]}

For example, if you add a CSV file to collection, each column in the CSV file is stored as a separate field in the index.\n\nA maximum of 1,000 fields can be added to the index.\n\nYou cannot assign the data type, such as Date or String, of a field. The data type is detected automatically and assigned to the field during document ingestion. The assignment is based on the data type that is detected from the first document that is indexed. Ingestion errors can occur in subsequent documents if a different data type is detected for the value in the same field. Therefore, if your documents have a mix of data types in a single field, first ingest the document that has a value with the most flexible data type, such as String, in the field.\n\nWhen you crawl a website or upload an HTML file, the HTML content is added to the collection and indexed in an html field.\n\nThe following table shows the maximum size limit for fields per document.\n\n\n\nMaximum field sizes\n\n Field type Maximum allowed size per document \n\n html field 5 MB \n Sum of all other fields 1 MB \n\n\n\nIf the maximum size of the fields in the document exceeds the allowed limits, they are treated as follows:\n\n\n\n* For a document with an oversized html field, all of the fields in the document are indexed except the html field.\n\nFor IBM Cloud Pak for Data version 4.0 and earlier, the entire document is not indexed.\n* For a document with oversized non-HTML fields, the document is not indexed.\n\n\n\nIf you are uploading a Microsoft Excel file and a message is displayed that indicates that the non-HTML field size limit is exceeded, consider converting the XLS file into a CSV file.

If you're attaching a file, make sure to include the correct filename and path in the attachment URL. If you're uploading an image or PDF, ensure they are correctly formatted as attachments.\n3. Attachments should be included within the `attachments` parameter when creating a document. Otherwise, the attachment won't be saved to the index.\n4.

Larger attachments may cause performance issues and could lead to storage errors.\n\nIn summary, while you can attach attachments to documents in IBM Cloudant, adhere to the guidelines provided above to prevent any unexpected problems.
